"What is 
    Digital Products & Platforms 
?","## Empowering Project Managers and Product Managers with the relevant
knowledge, skills and tools to plan, manage and deliver successful projects
and products.
The success of projects and products is pivotal in increasing an
organisation's business competitive advantage. Continual digital evolution
offers huge innovative possibilities in engaging customers in a constantly
evolving world and this has placed great importance on the project manager and
product manager role.  
  
Project management is no longer just about delivering scope within schedule
and budget; it must unlock the value and the strategic benefits that the
projects and products bring to the organisation and stakeholders. It is
essential that the individual tasked with the responsibility be equipped with
the necessary skills that are as diverse as the multitude of challenges faced.  
  
Best practice frameworks from Programme, Project and Product Management
complemented with resurgent practices such as Agile and Lean, will help
Product and Project Managers deliver better products in shorter cycles; while
continuous engagement with stakeholders and customers helps to validate/assure
the value of the products and services developed.
Our training roadmap for Project and Product Management is designed to equip
business executives, IT and non-IT professionals involved in project and
product delivery with the skills to execute their role more effectively. With
a team of industry practitioners that have an average experience exceeding 20
years, NUS-ISS is able to help both organisations and individuals to learn and
apply methodologies, best practices, and techniques in the workplace.  
  
As a Project Management Institute (PMI®) Global Registered Education Provider
(R.E.P.), NUS-ISS offers project management and related training which give
you Professional Development Units (PDUs) to maintain your PMP® credential.

those tasked to deliver and implement these analytical capabilities and
programmes successfully.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Communicating and Managing Change 
?","## Overview
The introduction of new technologies and the continual evolution of existing
IT systems presents incredible opportunities and simultaneous challenges to
the modern organisation. Technology alone cannot transform a business. It is
critical that the people involved in the implementation and utilisation of new
solutions are willing to embrace them as well. An understanding of change
management principles can greatly improve the project manager’s chance of
success in introducing IT or digital change.
In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation,
the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new
opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a
skilled, change-ready workforce. This not only helps to ensure success but
just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The
effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT
and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for
change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project
teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to
embark on the transformation journey.
This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our
lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and
internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they
have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be
highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.
The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with
the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles
of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all
change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended
learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT
case study activities to support participants in practical application of the
skills taught.  
  
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Products
& Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS. Series offered by NUS-ISS.
__Upon successful completion of this course, y_ ou will earn **19.5** PDUs

"What is 
    Digital Products & Platforms 
?","## Empowering Project Managers and Product Managers with the relevant
knowledge, skills and tools to plan, manage and deliver successful projects
and products.
The success of projects and products is pivotal in increasing an
organisation's business competitive advantage. Continual digital evolution
offers huge innovative possibilities in engaging customers in a constantly
evolving world and this has placed great importance on the project manager and
product manager role.  
  
Project management is no longer just about delivering scope within schedule
and budget; it must unlock the value and the strategic benefits that the
projects and products bring to the organisation and stakeholders. It is
essential that the individual tasked with the responsibility be equipped with
the necessary skills that are as diverse as the multitude of challenges faced.  
  
Best practice frameworks from Programme, Project and Product Management
complemented with resurgent practices such as Agile and Lean, will help
Product and Project Managers deliver better products in shorter cycles; while
continuous engagement with stakeholders and customers helps to validate/assure
the value of the products and services developed.
Our training roadmap for Project and Product Management is designed to equip
business executives, IT and non-IT professionals involved in project and
product delivery with the skills to execute their role more effectively. With
a team of industry practitioners that have an average experience exceeding 20
years, NUS-ISS is able to help both organisations and individuals to learn and
apply methodologies, best practices, and techniques in the workplace.  
  
As a Project Management Institute (PMI®) Global Registered Education Provider
(R.E.P.), NUS-ISS offers project management and related training which give
you Professional Development Units (PDUs) to maintain your PMP® credential.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     RESTful API Design  
?","As the internet has evolved from a collection of static documents to an
ecosystem of connected services and data providers it has brought with it the
API revolution. APIs serve as the fabric that interlinks data flow on this
modern evolution of Internet. They provide access to services that drive all
of the interactions that we all take for granted when we do everyday tasks
such as set up a calendar event on our laptops and have it instantly appear on
our smartphones, wearable devices, and even our home appliances.
In this RESTful API Design course, students will learn to explore, identify,
consume and implement REST API resources using common industry standard tools.
Students will examine a variety of popular APIs to help understand how and
where they are used. Students will also get the opportunity to consume public
APIs and implement their own APIs in language of their choice.
The course will also cover API design, caching techniques and securing the API
endpoint.
By the end of this 4 day course, you will have a thorough understanding of
API, how they work and how to implement them efficiently in your application.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Supervised and Unsupervised Modeling with Machine Learning 
?","Machine Learning uses techniques to deal with data in the most intelligent way
– by developing algorithms – to derive actionable insights. With machine
learning, you can glean useful patterns from the deep, focused troves of data
specific to your chosen domain. Analysing that data provide insights that can
drive successive new waves of efficiency and automation, reducing operational
costs and potentially pinpointing new sources of revenue.
This course is part of a series of courses around Machine Learning-driven Data
Science (MLDDS), under the StackUp – Startup Tech Talent Development programme
offered by NUS-ISS.
The courses in the MLDDS series are:
  1. NICF – Data and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning 
  2. **NICF – Supervised and Unsupervised Modeling with Machine Learning  [this course]**
  3. NICF – Feature Extraction and Supervised Modeling with Deep Learning 
  4. NICF – Sequence Modeling with Deep Learning 
Throughout all courses, you will experience the 3 building blocks in machine
learning:
  1. Concepts and intuition: Participants learn and apply the concepts of machine learning using a methodology. You will learn to navigate smoothly through the data sciences and machine learning space by not only creating but also debugging your products with ease. You will then apply the same concepts covered in a real world scenario while in class.
  2. Architecture: Participants learn what is required to architect a data science platform / team and how to effectively design a machine learning driven data sciences product using a wide range of techniques that are taught and practised in class. This includes, but is not limited to, understanding different parts of a data science product. The main goal of this course is to provoke thinking, establish the context of learning with the objective of developing and enhancing your capabilities in establishing a machine learning product.
  3. Implementation: Finally, participants will have the opportunity to apply the concepts using industry standard libraries and tools to develop their own machine learning driven data science project.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Sequence Modeling with Deep Learning 
?","Machine Learning uses techniques to deal with data in the most intelligent way
– by developing algorithms – to derive actionable insights. With machine
learning, you can glean useful patterns from the deep, focused troves of data
specific to your chosen domain. Analysing that data provide insights that can
drive successive new waves of efficiency and automation, reducing operational
costs and potentially pinpointing new sources of revenue.  
This course is part of a series of courses around Machine Learning-driven Data
Science (MLDDS), under the StackUp – Startup Tech Talent Development programme
offered by NUS-ISS.  
  
The courses in the MLDDS series are:
  1. NICF – Data and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning 
  2. NICF – Supervised and Unsupervised Modeling with Machine Learning 
  3. NICF – Feature Extraction and Supervised Modeling with Deep Learning 
  4. **NICF – Sequence Modeling with Deep Learning  [this course]**
Throughout all courses, you will experience the 3 building blocks in machine
learning:
  1. Concepts and intuition: Participants learn and apply the concepts of machine learning using a methodology. You will learn to navigate smoothly through the data sciences and machine learning space by not only creating but also debugging your products with ease. You will then apply the same concepts covered in a real world scenario while in class.
  2. Architecture: Participants learn what is required to architect a data science platform / team and how to effectively design a machine learning driven data sciences product using a wide range of techniques that are taught and practised in class. This includes, but is not limited to, understanding different parts of a data science product. The main goal of this course is to provoke thinking, establish the context of learning with the objective of developing and enhancing your capabilities in establishing a machine learning product.
  3. Implementation: Finally, participants will have the opportunity to apply the concepts using industry standard libraries and tools to develop their own machine learning driven data science project.

"What is 
    Software Systems
?","## A focus for advanced education and applied research in Software
Engineering, Design and Development, linking academic theory to industry
practice
In today's modern age, software is the fuel of the technology engine. Without
it there would be no social media, internet TV or radio and smartphones,
amongst others. We would still be relying on traditional print media for news
and when it comes to personal entertainment, we would be making our way to the
shop for our dose of music CDs. e-Commerce would be non-existent and life as
we know it would not have progressed to what it has become today.
As technology becomes an essential part of our daily lives, what separates one
technology from another is its software. It is the key component that
determines a technology's user-friendly capability and, in most instance,
making it fun to use as well. There's no denying that we are in the golden age
of software. Development and design are the foundations of truly successful
and applicable software.
One of the tenets of software development is that skill beats scale every
time. A small core team of highly skilled software architects and developers
can indeed deliver high impact high resilience systems faster and better than
a large team of less experienced workers.
NUS-ISS offers an extensive range of core courses to equip IT professionals
with the necessary and important tools to elevate their competency and
increase their capabilities, enabling them to make even more significant
contributions to their organisations.
The Software Systems training curriculum is aligned with national focus areas
and national training frameworks, which enables us to offer courses that are
relevant and timely to the demands of today's technology-driven business
environments.
If you are interested to take your Software Engineering & Design career
further, you may wish to explore our Master of Technology in Software

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Agile Testing 
?","Many organisations develop software using an Agile methodology.  
  
An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and
incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as
faster time-to-market and cost & time savings.  
  
The Agile approach's benefits to the organisation are:  
  
  * Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
  * Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
  * Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
  * The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
  * A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
  * Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
  * The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software
development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is
an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs
evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project
teams.  
  
Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are
detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so,
the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go
down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and
defects early.  
  
This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to
Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software
products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).  
  
**Advantages of Agile Testing:  
**  
  * Improves quality
  * Saves time and money
  * Reduces documentation
  * Team gets regular feedback from end users
This course is part of the Software Systems series and Digital Agility series
offered by NUS-ISS.
"
"What is the 
     Agile Testing 
 course key takeaway?","At the end of the course, the participants will be able to:  
  
  * Understand the mindset, culture and principles behind the Agile approach to software development
  * Differentiate between the testing role in Agile teams compared to that in traditional teams
  * Contribute positively as an Agile team member focused on Agile testing
  * Recognise the challenges and difficulties associated with non-testing activities performed in an Agile team
  * Understand and apply the following within an Agile project: Test estimation, test planning, test design (Test Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development), test execution, defect management and test closure
  * Support the team's accountability for quality
  * Demonstrate a range of soft skills required by effective Agile team members
  
* * *
  
"
"Who should attend 
     Agile Testing 
 course ?","It is applicable for professionals engaged in the following areas:  
  
  * Members of software development teams who wish to increase their effectiveness in performing testing activities within an Agile framework, such as Scrum, including: 
    * Product Owners
    * Business Analysts

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Designing Cloud-enabled Mobile Applications 
?","Mobile devices have become the essential delivery platform for business.
Businesses recognise that mobility solutions are becoming their main channel
when reaching out to their employees, customers and partners. The driving
forces include improving internal communication, boosting customer retention,
increasing speed of decision-making, reducing costs, improving efficiency and
acquiring new customers.  
  
Therefore, we are convinced that mobility is the way of life. The question is
how to extend our enterprise services onto the mobile platform. There is
already a set of existing mature and stable enterprise web applications.
However, do we duplicate the services onto the mobile platform? Do we redesign
part of or all of the applications? Or do we simply make our web applications
adaptable to the mobile browser? There is also a need to decide which mobile
platform to adopt - mobile web or native app, as well as which backend
solution platform is most suitable and affordable.  
  
This course aims to equip the participants with knowledge in designing mobile
enterprise solutions, evaluating mobile development technologies and
identifying security concerns pertaining to mobile enterprise solutions. With
this knowledge, the participants will be able to evaluate their existing suite
of traditional and web application, and redesign them for the mobile platform.
They would be able to compare and contrast different mobile development
technologies and select the appropriate one for their organisation, based on
their needs.  
  
The course will be conducted with a significant proportion on the hands-on
workshop, which will walk participants through topics like mobile application
design, development platform evaluation and security consideration. It will
deepen the participants' understanding of how to apply the unique
characteristics of mobile solutions in an enterprise environment.  
  
This course is part of the Software Systems Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Object Oriented Analysis & Design 
?","Delving straight into system development without applying **proper analysis
and design** is similar to building a house without a blueprint. This would
mean having to spend more time and resources on reworks and patches later in
the development phase in order to solve problems that could have been avoided
if appropriate development techniques had been applied.
The **Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD** ) **techniques** helps to:
  * Speed up software development processes
  * Increase developers’ productivity by promoting software reuse
  * Facilitate effective software integration
  * Reduce software maintenance and enhancement efforts
  * Support continuous integration and delivery
**Workshops** are **** specially tailored to take participants through the
system development process; from requirements to design workflow. Participants
will get hands-on experience on the application of **OOAD techniques** through
the relevant cycles.
This course not only helps **system designers and developers** to leverage on
the benefits of **OOAD techniques** , thereby reducing maintenance costs and
increasing software quality, it also helps **project managers / leaders /
Scrum masters / team members** to better manage software development
processes.
_Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn **19** PDUs (PM: 19)
that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose
of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number
of ISS is “2339”. _

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Object Oriented Design Patterns 
?","Just as buildings are constructed using proven designs, software too can be
built utilising proven solutions to common problems. Reapplying design pattern
solutions to new applications reduces the development cost and lends itself to
extensibility.  
  
This course teaches participants to solve tough design problems by adapting
proven designs called design patterns. By reusing proven solutions on the
right problems in the right contexts, you will be able to solve design
problems that you may not have been able to do previously.  
  
This course provides an in-depth look into how experts apply design skills. A
case study and a programming exercise will provide an opportunity for hands-on
design discussions.  
  
Design patterns should be applied whenever a new software application is being
architected and designed. They should also be applied when there is a need to
‘refactor’ or improve existing software applications. The course highlights
the relevance of design patterns in both contemporary and agile software
engineering lifecycles.  
  
This course is part of the Software Systems series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     DevOps Engineering and Automation 
?","The process to release software to users is often painful, risky and time
consuming. Continuous Delivery can help large organisations to become lean,
agile and innovative by having reliable and low risks releases, making it
possible to adapt continuous updates in line with user feedback, market shifts
and changes to business strategies.
As a result, the entire delivery process is accelerated while improving the
quality. Teams from test, support, development and operations function and
work together as one delivery team.

?","As Singapore progresses into a Smart Nation, Internet of Things (IoT) devices
will be ubiquitous. Imagine a world where millions of devices are connected -
we eventually will be seeing, hearing and sensing information via the Internet
and improve productivity and the quality of human life. With this, comes
challenges with IoT security as the next frontier in Cybersecurity.  
  
Smart City and Industry 4.0 Solutions are highly dependent on Internet of
Thing (IoT) devices as the key source of data. To have good data integrity and
quality at the IoT devices (at the source), the security of the IoT devices is
a key consideration in its deployment.  
  
This is a 2-day course where participants are expected to come with an
appreciation for IoT and build the security aspect upon it. Through the use of
a case study, we will apply risk analysis methodology to assess the risk and
design security controls to protect the IoT solutions while ensuring

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Design Secure Mobile Architecture 
?","As mobile adoption grows, so do security threats. Mobile devices are already
an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing
conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and
tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner
predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and
tablets in this year.  
  
Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of
which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop
applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the
mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed
and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these
applications create.  
  
This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls
to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and
integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By
combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares
the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security
architecture for businesses.  
  
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series,
Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in
Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS  
"

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Secure Software Development Lifecycle for Agile 
?","In light of heightened information security concerns, software development
lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by
Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security
exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns,
where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the
application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct
security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in
their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework,
such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development
in multiple iterations or sprints.
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into
the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce
applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series,
Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in
Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS.

"What is 
    Software Systems
?","## A focus for advanced education and applied research in Software
Engineering, Design and Development, linking academic theory to industry
practice
In today's modern age, software is the fuel of the technology engine. Without
it there would be no social media, internet TV or radio and smartphones,
amongst others. We would still be relying on traditional print media for news
and when it comes to personal entertainment, we would be making our way to the
shop for our dose of music CDs. e-Commerce would be non-existent and life as
we know it would not have progressed to what it has become today.
As technology becomes an essential part of our daily lives, what separates one
technology from another is its software. It is the key component that
determines a technology's user-friendly capability and, in most instance,
making it fun to use as well. There's no denying that we are in the golden age
of software. Development and design are the foundations of truly successful
and applicable software.
One of the tenets of software development is that skill beats scale every
time. A small core team of highly skilled software architects and developers
can indeed deliver high impact high resilience systems faster and better than
a large team of less experienced workers.
NUS-ISS offers an extensive range of core courses to equip IT professionals
with the necessary and important tools to elevate their competency and
increase their capabilities, enabling them to make even more significant
contributions to their organisations.
The Software Systems training curriculum is aligned with national focus areas
and national training frameworks, which enables us to offer courses that are
relevant and timely to the demands of today's technology-driven business
environments.
If you are interested to take your Software Engineering & Design career
further, you may wish to explore our Master of Technology in Software
Engineering programme.

"What is 
    Digital Strategy & Leadership
?","## Harness and experience the benefits of our digital leadership programmes.
The role of the ICT leader has evolved from being one who implements IT
solutions supporting the organisation's strategy, to one who is a significant
contributor to the organisation's digital strategy and survival. A strong
digital leadership enables an organisation to take advantage of new digital
opportunities, respond to potential threats, to stay ahead of the digital
wave, set the right direction forward, and inspire others to surf the wave of
technological changes.
NUS-ISS leadership courses provide the participants the opportunity to learn
from IT-savvy business leaders on the essential skills, practices and mind-set
in the digital age. We pride ourselves in our ability to create an industry-
oriented and practice-based learning environment. This allows participants to

"
"Can you give me an overview of 
     Communicating and Managing Change 
?","## Overview
The introduction of new technologies and the continual evolution of existing
IT systems presents incredible opportunities and simultaneous challenges to
the modern organisation. Technology alone cannot transform a business. It is
critical that the people involved in the implementation and utilisation of new
solutions are willing to embrace them as well. An understanding of change
management principles can greatly improve the project manager’s chance of
success in introducing IT or digital change.
In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation,
the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new
opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a
skilled, change-ready workforce. This not only helps to ensure success but
just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The
effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT
and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for
change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project
teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to
embark on the transformation journey.
This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our
lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and
internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they
have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be
highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.
The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with
the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles
of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all
change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended
learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT
case study activities to support participants in practical application of the
skills taught.  
  
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Products
& Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS. Series offered by NUS-ISS.

next scheduled for 10-12 July
The pace of digital disruption in today’s environment is such that digital
transformation is needed to enable technology advancements, together with
physical and digital assets, to improve customer experience and thereby create
a competitive advantage for organisations. The process of _Digital Technology
Planning_ helps to identify gaps and build bridges between people, process,
technology and increasingly, information. This enables organisations, if not
the opportunity to be disruptors, the ability to withstand any disruptions
that come their way.
This course examines an organisation and how it can embrace digital in the
pursuit of value creation. It introduces tools for internal and external
analysis to help identify digital opportunities. An architectural approach is
then taken to create a transformation plan.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Data Driven Decision Making

beginning and at end of the process, framing the problems and analysing the
results to provide the recommendations for sound decision making. These
managers’ equally need to know and understand data science, combining it with
their knowledge of the business and the business needs, to address challenges
faced by the organisation.  
  
When presented with analytics output, business decision makers commonly have
the following questions and uncertainties. It is necessary for the end
consumers of data analytics to know how to discern good analytics work from a

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Business Agility Bootcamp 
?","Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a
rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting
practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in
software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.  
  
The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied
customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-
market.  
  
Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be
limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital
transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable
(resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive).
Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for
organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be
better at innovation, according to the best research.  
  
This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to
digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices
across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile
organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for
managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the
current to the desired Agile state.  
  
This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for
specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership
and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Business Processing Reengineering (BPR), as defined by Michael Hammer, is the
fundamental re-thinking and radical redesign of business processes to bring
about dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance,
such as cost, quality, service and speed. With the resurgence of Robotic
Process Automation (RPA) fuelled by machine intelligence, BPR is again centre
stage as many companies will need to rethink their existing business processes
in the light of digital transformation prior to automating it.  
  
ISS is recognised as the most established institution with experience in
offering the BPR course, having trained more than 10,000 people in Singapore
over the past two decades. Participants have leveraged BPR to impact many
industries including finance, healthcare, logistics and government. This
course is taught by highly experienced instructors, who are former consultants
from leading consulting firms with more than 10 years of experience in running
BPR projects.
In this course, participants will learn why BPR is in demand, when to and when
not to use BPR and more importantly, how to do it effectively and
successfully. Beyond just theory, you will benefit from rich class notes and
unique case studies. You will also benefit from the sharing of real-life
scenarios, tips and techniques to help you avoid the many pitfalls of BPR and
how to overcome the many challenges when implementing it.
_Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn_ _**17**_ ****_PDUs
(PM: 14.75, Leadership: 2.25) that can be used to maintain your PMP ®_
_credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP ®_

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Design Secure Mobile Architecture 
?","As mobile adoption grows, so do security threats. Mobile devices are already
an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing
conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and
tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner
predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and
tablets in this year.  
  
Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of
which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop
applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the
mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed
and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these
applications create.  
  
This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls
to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and
integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By
combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares
the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security
architecture for businesses.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Secure Software Development Lifecycle for Agile 
?","In light of heightened information security concerns, software development
lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by
Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security
exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns,
where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the
application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct
security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in
their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework,
such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development
in multiple iterations or sprints.
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into
the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce
applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series,
Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in
Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS.  
  
_Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn **10** PDUs
(Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting,
the PMI ® REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”._
"
"What is the 
     Secure Software Development Lifecycle for Agile

  * Understand the importance of designing secure software applications, risks and mitigations
  * Identify key Bodies of Knowledge for secure software development
  * Adopt secure development practices within an existing process
  * Adopt secure development practices for the end-to-end processes

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Cybersecurity Risk Awareness 
?","In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more
critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences
demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats – from individual, opportunistic
hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies
to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even
threaten our safety.  
  
Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer
sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management
of humans – the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place
the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right
enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone
within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to
technical “experts” – the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that
the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address
cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats
and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable
organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone’s
responsibility – no exception.  
  
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership
Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Managing Cybersecurity Risk 
?","With Singapore’s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive
adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy
(CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean
organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats
posed by cyber threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to
professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to
systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even
threaten our safety.  
  
In today’s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire
business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in
cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats.
Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises
cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with
business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.
This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement
the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations
your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that
will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it
provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response
Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of
knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private
enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience
will also be discussed.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership
Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"What is the

  * Have knowledge of potential cyber threats and system vulnerabilities
  * Be able to identify the threats and risks that are relevant to his/her organisation and systems
  * Be able to assesses the business impact of the identified threats and formulate possible responses
  * Plan and communicate cybersecurity requirements with stakeholders
  * Plan swift response to cyber attacks
  * Be able to establish or improve decision-making during cyber attacks

Malicious cyber activities have evolved in sophistication, and stealth and
teamwork are required to counter this. Not only cybersecurity professionals,
ICT professionals too need to play their part in helping their organisations
protect their assets from the ever-pervasive cyber threats.  
  
The objective of this course is not to turn ICT professionals into

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Enterprise Digital Governance 
?","Technology such as data analytics, mobility, social media and smart embedded
devices are radically transforming businesses and government. It is changing
business-customer, business-business, government-citizen and people-people
interactions. It is also changing business models, business processes,
customer behaviours and government policies. However, although technology
presents new opportunities, it also creates new challenges including that of
cybersecurity resiliency.  
  
In today’s digital environments and smart cities, technological changes are
digitally disrupting how business is conducted. They open the door to a flood
of data such as traffic flow, energy use, water consumption, spending habits,
search patterns, browsing history, etc. These pose security issues, raise
privacy concerns and threaten the safety of our critical information and
infrastructure operational capability.  
  
This course seeks to answer these challenges by providing a firm understanding
and practice of enterprise digital governance mechanisms. The essence of
enterprise digital governance enables the creation of a flexible system for
maintaining accountability, roles and decision-making in the face of
technological changes and to create value from the effective and sustainable
use of assets.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by
NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
    e-Government Leadership
?","## Overview
Managing the common challenges including rapid urbanisation, building a
fundamentally sound financial sector or fostering entrepreneurship and
innovation, requires effective governance. Technology is an enabler and
essential tool in delivering good governance as it facilitates transparency,
accountability, efficiency and productivity.
Participants in this course will learn the key principles needed for the
development of IT policies and standards that will support scalability,
security, inter-operability, data exchange and integration. It will introduce
a framework that enables participants to acquire the skills in identifying IT
opportunities and prioritise them. It will also explore how proper IT planning
creates long-term business value while optimising IT resources for the
organisation – be it for a ministry or department.
Techniques like sense-making will be introduced to help develop technological
options for different scenarios. The options will be analysed with an
assessment of the range of outcomes in order to select a best course of action
that achieves the goals of the organisation.
Strategies for technology acquisition will be discussed. These include
considerations for “build”, “buy” or “outsource” decisions, defining and
measuring outcome-based service levels and public private partnership models.
Design Thinking seeks to stimulate creative thinking to accelerate effective
synthesis of policy, process and technology solutions. Participants will learn
concepts of design thinking that will lay the foundation of transformation and
help focus on citizens and businesses. Topics on stakeholder management,
effective communication and transformational leadership will be introduced and
discussed.
The deployment of new technologies, systems, processes will invariably impact
the stakeholders and result in changes. Communication of such changes need to
be planned carefully so as to ensure human inertia and resistance are
overcome, leading to accelerated adoption of the change. Discussion will
include critical role of Change Champions, who lead transformation and
interactions across administrative compartments in the public sector,
stakeholders and interface between public administration and businesses and
citizens at large.
IT Governance and Risk Management is the management of the business risk
associated with the use, ownership, operations, involvement and influence of
IT within an organisation. This segment will highlight the importance of
having a sound governance process in managing the IT investment with all
stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. Compliance to relevant
laws, regulations, contractual agreements and policies will also be discussed.
This programme is designed for extensive interaction and discussions to
facilitate exchange of ideas amongst practitioners and experiential learning.  
#### Format
Lectures, workshops and discussions
#### Class Time
The total duration of the programme is 4 days, structured into 2 segments.
First segment is of 3 days duration, which will cover the topics outlined
above.
The second segment will be scheduled for 1 day after 6 weeks. This will allow
the participants to apply the concepts and frameworks to real life scenarios
in their respective work environment during the 6 weeks. Re-convening for 1
day provides an opportunity for the participants to share their implementation
experiences, solicit ideas to address challenges encountered, thus enriching
their learning experience.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by
NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
    Specialist Diploma in Enterprise Architecture
?","## Overview
An enterprise architect links the business mission, strategy and processes of
an organisation to its IT and presents how the current and future needs of an
organisation will be met in an efficient and agile manner. ISS is pleased to
offer the Specialist Diploma in Enterprise Architecture to equip practitioners
with in-depth knowledge and best practices in Enterprise Architecture (EA).
The Specialist Diploma is made up of two parts:
  * Part A – 7-day  Certified Enterprise Architecture Practitioner Course  (conducted over 3 weeks)
  * Part B (Choose one pathway) – Experience Requirements
    * Pathway 1: 20 weeks of  Enterprise Architecture Practicum  at the participant’s organisation, with ISS lecturer-mentor
    * Pathway 2: Assessment Only Pathway (AOP) , where the participant has completed an EA for his/her organisation
A participant has to successfully complete Part A and obtain all the 4 NICF EA
Statements of Attainment (SOAs) before embarking on the practicum (20 weeks).
The specialist diploma combines formal practice-based education with a
customised practicum. The customised practicum allows participants to adopt,
learn and master EA in the context of their organisation. It is designed to
validate the existence of those qualities and skills in a participant which
enable the effective practice of EA. As such, the programme is skills,
knowledge and experience-based and goes beyond validating the mastery of any
specific EA knowledge base.
The qualification will be awarded to EA practitioners to recognise their
ability to apply EA skills, knowledge and experience in the context of their
organisation’s EA.
This course is on demand only. Please email us for enquiries.
