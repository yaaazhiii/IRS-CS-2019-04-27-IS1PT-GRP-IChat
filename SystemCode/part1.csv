"Can you give me an overview of 
     Digital User Experience Design 
?","**Note: Please bring your laptop (Mac or Windows) to the course as you will be
doing website evaluation and hands on prototyping workshops.**  
  
This 3-day introductory course focuses on the principles and techniques in the
design of good user experience in software applications. It traverses through
the requirement, analysis, design and validation phases of the user experience
design life cycle with emphasis on building empathy with users. Case
scenarios, examples, exercises and workshops will be used throughout the
course for participants to individually experience and reflect on what is good
and bad UX design.  
  
Designing for applications is about more than just usability. It is also about
how well a particular application is able to relate, interact and serve for a
meaningful experience. Good user experience encourages a higher engagement
rate and sustained use of the applications. It also renders a beneficial
experience for the user, which can lead to an increase in productivity. Bad
user experience often leads to a myriad of issues and arguably one of the most
damaging, is to the organisation’s or company’s image.  
  
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design Series offered by NUS-
ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Social Media Analytics 
?","It is not enough to just employ social media tools. The ability to analyse and
understand their impact, is fast becoming a business imperative. The insights
embedded within social media can empower your organisation to make intelligent
business decisions. These can lead to improvements in your customer and
employee loyalty and in maximising the value of your efforts in sales,
marketing, customer service, employee relations and product development. By
understanding what your customers think about your organisations, products and
services, you can then act quickly and remain competitive.
The Social Media Analytics course will help you to analyse and understand the
impact of social media. These include:
  * What is the direct value of your Facebook page?
  * What is the ROI through your Twitter?
  * How to measure the impact of business metrics from your website or blog?
  * If you launch a social media campaign, how effective is the campaign?
With the massive volume and unrelenting continuity of social media, content
can be overwhelming. How does a business make sense of it? How can you act
upon the trends and sentiments within? And more crucially, how do you deliver
the right social media intelligence to the right people at the right time to
gain a competitive advantage?
During this course, you will learn how to effectively utilise social media
analytics to create value for your organisation in the different departments
which include:
**Marketing:**
  * Measure the value of social media to justify a capital investment
  * Integrate and implement an end-to-end social media strategy
  * Provide insights into current campaigns and improve on future ones
**Sales:**
  * Develop personalised offers that resonate with customers to increase sales
**Product management:**
  * Understand consumers in new markets and their specific cultural attributes
  * Develop and evolve products and solutions from direct social media analysis
**Customer service:**
  * Understand real customer issues and identify trends versus one-of-a-kind issues
  * Respond to and resolve customer issues before they become major problems
Through this course, you will not only learn to interpret the social media
data gathered using social media monitoring tools but also, make sense of
these data in order to take effective actions.
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design series and Data Science
series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Digital User Experience Design 
?","**Note: Please bring your laptop (Mac or Windows) to the course as you will be
doing website evaluation and hands on prototyping workshops.**  
  
This 3-day introductory course focuses on the principles and techniques in the
design of good user experience in software applications. It traverses through
the requirement, analysis, design and validation phases of the user experience
design life cycle with emphasis on building empathy with users. Case
scenarios, examples, exercises and workshops will be used throughout the
course for participants to individually experience and reflect on what is good
and bad UX design.  
  
Designing for applications is about more than just usability. It is also about
how well a particular application is able to relate, interact and serve for a
meaningful experience. Good user experience encourages a higher engagement
rate and sustained use of the applications. It also renders a beneficial
experience for the user, which can lead to an increase in productivity. Bad
user experience often leads to a myriad of issues and arguably one of the most
damaging, is to the organisation’s or company’s image.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Social Media Analytics 
?","It is not enough to just employ social media tools. The ability to analyse and
understand their impact, is fast becoming a business imperative. The insights
embedded within social media can empower your organisation to make intelligent
business decisions. These can lead to improvements in your customer and
employee loyalty and in maximising the value of your efforts in sales,
marketing, customer service, employee relations and product development. By
understanding what your customers think about your organisations, products and
services, you can then act quickly and remain competitive.
The Social Media Analytics course will help you to analyse and understand the
impact of social media. These include:
  * What is the direct value of your Facebook page?
  * What is the ROI through your Twitter?
  * How to measure the impact of business metrics from your website or blog?
  * If you launch a social media campaign, how effective is the campaign?
With the massive volume and unrelenting continuity of social media, content
can be overwhelming. How does a business make sense of it? How can you act
upon the trends and sentiments within? And more crucially, how do you deliver
the right social media intelligence to the right people at the right time to
gain a competitive advantage?
During this course, you will learn how to effectively utilise social media
analytics to create value for your organisation in the different departments
which include:
**Marketing:**
  * Measure the value of social media to justify a capital investment
  * Integrate and implement an end-to-end social media strategy
  * Provide insights into current campaigns and improve on future ones
**Sales:**
  * Develop personalised offers that resonate with customers to increase sales
**Product management:**
  * Understand consumers in new markets and their specific cultural attributes
  * Develop and evolve products and solutions from direct social media analysis
**Customer service:**
  * Understand real customer issues and identify trends versus one-of-a-kind issues
  * Respond to and resolve customer issues before they become major problems
Through this course, you will not only learn to interpret the social media
data gathered using social media monitoring tools but also, make sense of
these data in order to take effective actions.
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design series and Data Science
series offered by NUS-ISS.

"What is 
    Artificial Intelligence
?","## Harness the full potential of data and analytics to gain a competitive edge
in today's business climate.
The idea of a Smart Nation is creating a huge buzz particularly amongst
businesses and organisations. It's not hard to fathom why given the array of
potential benefits that it can bring to both service providers and consumers
alike. Big data is an essential factor in any business success and a key focus
in the Smart Nation initiatives. But it's not the size of the data that
matters; rather it's how you utilise them that counts.
Data and analytics are crucial in defining success for businesses. They
provide valuable insights for more intelligent decision-making and act as a
catalyst for positive change. The knowledge and information gathered are also
beneficial in the effort to remain competitive and achieve sustainable
success.
ISS provides a comprehensive suite of Artificial Intelligence courses that
will empower participants with the capability to make data driven and
evidence-based decisions. These assets are pivotal in the development of
effective strategic solutions and the effort to achieve greater competitive
advantage.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Text Processing using Machine Learning 
?","## Overview
We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and
people’s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from
Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are
AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.
AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially
act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent
business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The
technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the
years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine
learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form
of deep learning.
The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI’s huge
impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented
Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data
preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-
users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on
specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to
perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated
paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area – natural language processing
(NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).
In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position
over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much
higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text
classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation,
machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.
This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential
knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing
in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case
studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques
such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder
models, reinforcement learning, etc.
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Graduate Certificate in
Practical Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Text Processing using Machine Learning 
?","## Overview
We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and
people’s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from
Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are
AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.
AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially
act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent
business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The
technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the
years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine
learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form
of deep learning.
The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI’s huge
impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented
Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data
preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-
users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on
specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to
perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated
paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area – natural language processing
(NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).
In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position
over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much
higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text
classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation,
machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.
This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential
knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing
in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case
studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques
such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder
models, reinforcement learning, etc.
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Graduate Certificate in
Practical Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Design Secure Mobile Architecture 
?","As mobile adoption grows, so do security threats. Mobile devices are already
an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing
conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and
tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner
predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and
tablets in this year.  
  
Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of
which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop
applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the
mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed
and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these
applications create.  
  
This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls
to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and
integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By
combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares
the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security
architecture for businesses.  
  
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series,
Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in
Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS  
"
"What is the 
     Design Secure Mobile Architecture 
 course key takeaway?","On completion of this course, participants will be able to:  
  * Review mobile platform and mobile development components to identify key threats and vulnerabilities
  * Identify potential threat events and vulnerabilities in integration between the mobile app and the enterprise components
  * Analyse adequacy of security controls built into mobile architecture
  * Develop report detailing security design and considerations for the mobile project

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Secure Software Development Lifecycle for Agile 
?","In light of heightened information security concerns, software development
lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by
Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security
exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns,
where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the
application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct
security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in
their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework,
such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development
in multiple iterations or sprints.
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into
the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce
applications that meet security requirements.

Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in

"Can you give me an overview of 
     (ISC)2 CCSP CBK Training Seminar 
?","As more organisations adopt cloud-based systems, new complexities and
challenges surface. To ensure that cloud security professionals have the
required knowledge, skills and abilities to audit, assess and secure cloud
infrastructures, (ISC)² and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently
developed the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSPSM).
The CCSP credential reflects in-depth knowledge derived from hands-on
information security and cloud computing experience. It validates practical
know-how for professionals whose responsibilities involve cloud security
architecture, design, operations and service orchestration.
CCSP defines the qualifications and experience necessary to competently secure
cloud services. Ultimately, it provides a new benchmark for cloud security
knowledge and competence and is viewed as the most reliable indicator of
overall proficiency in cloud security.  
  
This course is part of the Cybersecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership
Series offered by NUS-ISS.
"

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Cybersecurity Risk Awareness 
?","In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more
critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences
demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats – from individual, opportunistic
hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies
to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even
threaten our safety.  
  
Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer
sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management
of humans – the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place
the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right
enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone
within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to
technical “experts” – the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that
the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address
cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats
and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable
organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone’s
responsibility – no exception.  
  
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership
Series offered by NUS-ISS.

  * Be able to prioritise potential cyber threats that can happen to their organisations and their ecosystems

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Managing Cybersecurity Risk 
?","With Singapore’s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive
adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy
(CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean
organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats
posed by cyber threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to
professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to
systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even
threaten our safety.  
  
In today’s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire
business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in
cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats.
Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises
cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with
business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.
This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement
the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations
your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that
will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it
provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response
Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of
knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private
enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience
will also be discussed.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership
Series offered by NUS-ISS.
"
"What is the 
     Managing Cybersecurity Risk 
 course key takeaway?","On completion of the course, participants will:
  * Understand the cybersecurity strategies and polices
  * Have knowledge of potential cyber threats and system vulnerabilities
  * Be able to identify the threats and risks that are relevant to his/her organisation and systems
  * Be able to assesses the business impact of the identified threats and formulate possible responses
  * Plan and communicate cybersecurity requirements with stakeholders
  * Plan swift response to cyber attacks
  * Be able to establish or improve decision-making during cyber attacks 
(ISC)² members could earn up to 19.5 Continuing Professional Education (CPEs

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Cyber Security for ICT Professionals 
?","As organisations embrace the digital revolution, so do cyber criminals.
Malicious cyber activities have evolved in sophistication, and stealth and
teamwork are required to counter this. Not only cybersecurity professionals,
ICT professionals too need to play their part in helping their organisations
protect their assets from the ever-pervasive cyber threats.  
  
The objective of this course is not to turn ICT professionals into
cybersecurity professionals, but to equip them with sufficient cybersecurity
knowledge so that they can incorporate security into their work at the outset
rather than as an afterthought or, worse still, not at all.

"What is 
    Data Science
?","## Harness the full potential of data and analytics to gain a competitive edge
in today's business climate.
The idea of a Smart Nation is creating a huge buzz particularly amongst
businesses and organisations. It's not hard to fathom why given the array of
potential benefits that it can bring to both service providers and consumers
alike. Big data is an essential factor in any business success and a key focus
in the Smart Nation initiatives. But it's not the size of the data that
matters; rather it's how you utilise them that counts.
Data and business analytics are crucial in defining success for businesses.
They provide valuable insights for more intelligent decision-making and act as
a catalyst for positive change. The knowledge and information gathered are
also beneficial in the effort to remain competitive and achieve sustainable
success.
ISS provides a comprehensive suite of Data Science courses that will empower
participants with the capability to make data driven and evidence-based
decisions. These assets are pivotal in the development of effective strategic
solutions and the effort to achieve greater competitive advantage.
The range of available courses includes the  Statistics Bootcamp. This
foundation course will equip participants with the capability to use R in
their statistical analysis to facilitate more accurate and effective data-
driven decisions. Another course on offer is the  Social Media Analytics,
an intermediate level course, where participant will acquire the skill to
interpret social media data and produce effective actions based on the
analytics.
With the increasing interests in business analytics and the advantages it can
render, more organisations and businesses are expected to join the data-driven
revolution. The Analytics and Intelligent Systems courses are designed to help
your business harness its true potential and more.
_For those who are keen to delve deeper into Analytics and Intelligent
Systems, you may want to explore ourMaster of Technology in Enterprise
Business Analytics programme._

manage the acquired data (both internal & external). The credibility and
usefulness of sophisticated data analytics solutions rest upon good quality
data. But good, clean data cannot always be readily available.
Over a period of 3 days, the course will provide participants with a practical
understanding of Data Analytics Process and Best Practices so that their
analytics activity downstream will be more credible and useful.
The course provides an intermediate pathway into technical ‘methods’ courses
in the ISS portfolio (such as those in the ISS-NICF Enterprise Business
Analytics syllabus).

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Managing Business Analytics Projects 
?","Business Analytics has earned a place as one of the core disruptors of the
digital age. Many companies’ business analytics initiatives have moved to
production, with some proven success, and now there is a continuing push to
leverage new data technologies to power business intelligence. Many government
agencies and private companies have jumped on this bandwagon and are heavily
investing in business analytics projects to gain new insights in order to
acquire a competitive edge to serve their customers and citizens.  
  
According to Gartner Research, the worldwide market for analytics will remain
the top focus for CIOs through 2017. This report cited that more than 30% of
organisations have invested in analysing “big data” but only a quarter (8% of
the total) have made it into production! It remains as a major challenge for
those tasked to deliver and implement these analytical capabilities and
programmes successfully.  
  
This course brings together latest thinking and best practices from the
various domains of Agile, Lean and Traditional project management to equip
business analytics teams with the knowledge and skills to effectively and
successfully manage business analytics projects.

the MIT Centre for Digital Business. One barrier to data-driven decision
making is the shortage of experienced talent in analytics.
Data modelling and engineering is the role of data scientists or data
analysts, business leaders and managers have a critical role to play at the
beginning and at end of the process, framing the problems and analysing the
results to provide the recommendations for sound decision making. These
managers’ equally need to know and understand data science, combining it with
their knowledge of the business and the business needs, to address challenges
faced by the organisation.  
  
When presented with analytics output, business decision makers commonly have
the following questions and uncertainties. It is necessary for the end
consumers of data analytics to know how to discern good analytics work from a
poor one.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Predictive Analytics - Insights of Trends and Irregularities 
?","There has been an increasing demand for business analytics, especially in the
recent years and this trend is set to experience a continual rise. Predictive
analytics is one of the most important areas of business analytics. It is all
about extracting information from data and using it to predict future trends
and behaviour patterns in businesses. In other words, predictive analytics
offers actionable business predictions through mining abundant historical
data. It has been widely used in many industries such as banking, insurance,
telecom, retail, travel, health care and has shown significant impact on
planning and business decision making. Many companies have been turning to
predictive analytics to thrive and compete against their competitors.  
  
This course will directly help participants utilise business data more
effectively by deriving insights of trends and irregularities from data and
applying them for forward-looking predictions. This is realised through
building predictive models with appropriate analytical techniques. Ultimately,
the company will gain a competitive advantage over its competitors as it would
become more proactive in the way it does business and marketing and thereby
reduce cost and increase return on investments.  
  
The objective of this course is to introduce participants to the concepts,
methods and techniques of predictive analytics. Participants will gain the
requisite skills to perform predictive analytics in real-life business
scenarios through workshops using either R or SPSS or JMP. The course will
assume that the participants have some preliminary knowledge of statistical
concepts like regression and logistic regression and some hands on experience
of modelling using these techniques, though the course will revisit these
concepts to refresh the theory. In case participants have no prior statistical
knowledge, it is strongly recommended that they attend the Statistics
Bootcamp  prior to attending this course.  
  
This course is part of the Data Science and Graduate Certificate in Business
Analytics Practice Series offered by NUS-ISS.
"
"What is the 
     Predictive Analytics - Insights of Trends and Irregularities 
 course key takeaway?","At the end of the course, participants will be able to:
  * Identify where predictive analytics can be applied and the benefits which can be derived
  * Evaluate the predictive model's objectives and data available
  * Design the predictive analytics process
  * Assess and select the appropriate testing methods to validate the predictive models
  * Analyse the results and communicate the decision to senior management and facilitate deployment to support the end users

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Text Analytics 
?","Do you know how to analyse customer sentiments about your company, products
and services? Or how to keep track of your company’s service & quality
delivery so that you are able to act quickly to insights that drive your
business?  
  
About 80% of enterprise-relevant data is in unstructured or semi-structured
format. These include emails, documents, surveys, feedback forms, warranty
claims, contact-centre notes and transcripts, web pages, news, data from
social media, audios, videos and many more. A predominant amount of such data
is available as text.  
  
In order to gain competitive edge in the market, businesses and organisations
are finding a growing need to expand their analysis scope to cover text data,
especially in regards to customer feedback and social media data. This is so
that critical insights can be uncovered to support business decision making
and process improvement.  
  
This course aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively
analyse large amounts of textual data such as customer feedback and social
media conversations to discover themes, patterns and trends to aid in
improving business process and decision making. In scenario-based case
studies, you will be introduced to common text analytics tasks such as data
pre-processing and preparation, linguistic/knowledge resources management,
concept extraction, text categorisation, clustering, association and trend
analysis. You will practise performing these tasks following a well-defined
process in hands-on sessions.  
  
This 3-day data mining course focuses on introducing the essential analytical
skills in modelling unstructured textual data such as customer feedback,
reviews or comments to business and IT professionals.  
  
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence, Graduate Certificate in
Business Analytics Practice and Graduate Certificate in Practice Language
Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.  
  
This course need only be taken **once** throughout the Stackable Programme in

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Recommender Systems 
?","Everyday decisions, from which products to buy, movies to watch and
restaurants to try, are more and more being put in the hands of a new source:
recommendation systems. Recommendation systems work by studying the past
behaviours and purchases of users along with their preferences and product
ratings. Using these and other relevant data they are able to provide
recommendations and choices of interest to users in terms of “Relevant Job
postings”, “Movies of Interest”, “Suggested Videos”, “People who bought this
also bought this” etc.
Recommender systems have been widely used by online shopping companies such as
Amazon.com. They play a critical role in analysing customer transactions and
web browsing behaviours to provide sound recommendations for their customers,
contributing to sales revenue and profitability. In this regard, a reliable
and efficient recommendation system is essential for many companies’ market
and business success.

About 80% of enterprise-relevant data is in unstructured or semi-structured
format. These include emails, documents, surveys, feedback forms, warranty
claims, contact-centre notes and transcripts, web pages, news, data from
social media, audios, videos and many more. A predominant amount of such data
is available as text.  
  
In order to gain competitive edge in the market, businesses and organisations
are finding a growing need to expand their analysis scope to cover text data,
especially in regards to customer feedback and social media data. This is so
that critical insights can be uncovered to support business decision making
and process improvement.  
  
This course aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively
analyse large amounts of textual data such as customer feedback and social
media conversations to discover themes, patterns and trends to aid in
improving business process and decision making. In scenario-based case
studies, you will be introduced to common text analytics tasks such as data
pre-processing and preparation, linguistic/knowledge resources management,
concept extraction, text categorisation, clustering, association and trend
analysis. You will practise performing these tasks following a well-defined
process in hands-on sessions.  
  
This 3-day data mining course focuses on introducing the essential analytical
skills in modelling unstructured textual data such as customer feedback,
reviews or comments to business and IT professionals.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Text Processing using Machine Learning 
?","## Overview
We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and
people’s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from
Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are
AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.
AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially
act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent
business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The
technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the
years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine
learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form
of deep learning.
The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI’s huge
impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented
Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data
preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-
users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on
specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to
perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated
paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area – natural language processing
(NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).
In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position
over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much
higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text
classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation,
machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.
This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential
knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing
in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case
studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques
such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder
models, reinforcement learning, etc.
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Graduate Certificate in
Practical Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
    Service Analytics 
?","Service analytics describes the process of capturing, processing and analysing
the data generated from the execution of a service system to improve, extend,
and personalise a service to create value for both providers and customers.  
  
Service analytics also covers process analytics and will be useful for those
who are managing processes and quality in service industries.  
  
The methodologies taught in this course are applicable to many industries
including IT Services, public services (e.g. Government agencies), Healthcare,
Finance Institutions (Retail Banking & Insurance), Airlines, Logistics,
Transport, Hotel, Tourism, Consumer services, etc.  
  
An organisation’s innovation potential depends on its capability to process
‘data’ about internal operations and the world outside the organization.  
  
The scope of this analytics-based capability is constantly expanded by the
development of new technologies making the generation, collection, and
analysis of data much easier.  
  
For many industries, more data and the ability to analyse that data in a
scientific manner, provide an opportunity to optimise, innovate, and
differentiate for growth and greater efficiency. This capability based on data
analytics is emerging as a critical factor to achieve competitive advantage.  
  
This course is part of the Data Science and Graduate Certificate in Advanced
Predictive Modelling Techniques Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Social Media Analytics 
?","It is not enough to just employ social media tools. The ability to analyse and
understand their impact, is fast becoming a business imperative. The insights
embedded within social media can empower your organisation to make intelligent
business decisions. These can lead to improvements in your customer and
employee loyalty and in maximising the value of your efforts in sales,
marketing, customer service, employee relations and product development. By
understanding what your customers think about your organisations, products and
services, you can then act quickly and remain competitive.
The Social Media Analytics course will help you to analyse and understand the
impact of social media. These include:
  * What is the direct value of your Facebook page?
  * What is the ROI through your Twitter?
  * How to measure the impact of business metrics from your website or blog?
  * If you launch a social media campaign, how effective is the campaign?
With the massive volume and unrelenting continuity of social media, content
can be overwhelming. How does a business make sense of it? How can you act
upon the trends and sentiments within? And more crucially, how do you deliver
the right social media intelligence to the right people at the right time to
gain a competitive advantage?
During this course, you will learn how to effectively utilise social media
analytics to create value for your organisation in the different departments
which include:
**Marketing:**
  * Measure the value of social media to justify a capital investment
  * Integrate and implement an end-to-end social media strategy
  * Provide insights into current campaigns and improve on future ones
**Sales:**
  * Develop personalised offers that resonate with customers to increase sales
**Product management:**
  * Understand consumers in new markets and their specific cultural attributes
  * Develop and evolve products and solutions from direct social media analysis
**Customer service:**
  * Understand real customer issues and identify trends versus one-of-a-kind issues
  * Respond to and resolve customer issues before they become major problems
Through this course, you will not only learn to interpret the social media
data gathered using social media monitoring tools but also, make sense of
these data in order to take effective actions.
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design series and Data Science
series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Business Agility Bootcamp 
?","Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a
rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting
practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in
software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.  
  
The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied
customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-
market.  
  
Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be
limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital
transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable
(resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive).
Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for
organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be
better at innovation, according to the best research.  
  
This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to
digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices
across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile
organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for
managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the
current to the desired Agile state.  
  
This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for
specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership
and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Agile Testing 
?","Many organisations develop software using an Agile methodology.  
  
An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and
incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as
faster time-to-market and cost & time savings.  
  
The Agile approach's benefits to the organisation are:  
  
  * Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
  * Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
  * Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
  * The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
  * A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
  * Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
  * The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software
development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is
an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs
evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project
teams.  
  
Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are
detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so,
the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go
down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and
defects early.  
  
This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to
Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software
products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).  
  
**Advantages of Agile Testing:  
**  
  * Improves quality
  * Saves time and money
  * Reduces documentation
  * Team gets regular feedback from end users
This course is part of the Software Systems series and Digital Agility series
offered by NUS-ISS.
"
"What is the 
     Agile Testing 
 course key takeaway?","At the end of the course, the participants will be able to:  
  
  * Understand the mindset, culture and principles behind the Agile approach to software development
  * Differentiate between the testing role in Agile teams compared to that in traditional teams
  * Contribute positively as an Agile team member focused on Agile testing
  * Recognise the challenges and difficulties associated with non-testing activities performed in an Agile team
  * Understand and apply the following within an Agile project: Test estimation, test planning, test design (Test Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development), test execution, defect management and test closure
  * Support the team's accountability for quality
  * Demonstrate a range of soft skills required by effective Agile team members
  
* * *
  
"
"Who should attend 
     Agile Testing 
 course ?","It is applicable for professionals engaged in the following areas:  
  
  * Members of software development teams who wish to increase their effectiveness in performing testing activities within an Agile framework, such as Scrum, including: 
    * Product Owners
    * Business Analysts
    * Solution Architects

"Can you give me an overview of 
    NICF - Lean IT Foundation Certification 
?","Do you feel that your IT processes (e.g. for projects, software development,
operations, infra management etc) are too complex, too bureaucratic, too slow,
have too much documentation and don’t satisfy your users and customers?  
  
One good way to improve this situation is to make use of Lean IT best
practices.  
  
Lean IT is the extension of Lean principles applied to IT products and
services. Lean IT can be interpreted as an IT process improvement strategy; a
way to design, transform and run the IT business so as to maximise customer
value and reduce waste. It focuses on improving value, efficiency and speed,
through reduction of waste within the value delivery processes of an IT
organisation.
The Lean concept has a great impact on the culture of an organisation as it
empowers employees to participate in the optimisation of processes. The
principles of Lean IT are applicable to all organisations with IT operations
regardless of industry or sector.
Lean IT is complementary to other frameworks and methods such as ITIL®, PMP®,
CMMI® and COBIT®. These frameworks provide guidelines on best-practice
processes but do not provide much guidance on how the implementation details
of the processes can be optimised to reduce waste and increase value to the
customer/user. Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.
Lean IT is also complementary to agile methods such as SCRUM. For example,
SCRUM recommends reflecting on completed SCRUM processes for improvement (e.g.
via sprint retrospective) but SCRUM does not give much guidance on how to
improve. Again, Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.
Lean companies are arguably more successful than non-lean companies in terms
of business value and retaining talent, and their success is more sustainable
over time.
This course teaches Lean IT Foundation principles and concepts. Class
exercises, workshops and quiz are used extensively to reinforce the
participants' understanding and practice of the concepts as well as assess the
competence of the participants. The course also includes the Lean IT
Foundation Exam which leads to the Lean IT Foundation Certificate for
successful participants.
The 60-minute, 40 questions, multiple-choice Lean IT Foundation certificate
exam is scheduled on the last day of the course.
Upon completion of this course, participants would be able to:
  * Broaden their skills on process improvement with a strong emphasis on focusing on value as seen from the customer’s perspective
  * Minimising waste and producing more efficient IT services, which in turn benefits the organisation
_This course is part of theDigital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.  
  
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn **14.5** PDUs (PM:
10.5, Leadership: 2, Business: 2) that can be used to maintain your PMP ®

"Can you give me an overview of 
     DevOps Foundation with BizOps 
?","Whether you are in IT or Project management, application development or IT
infra/operations, the growing business demand for ever faster time-to-market
means that you now need to know DevOps and BizOps, in addition to Agile.  
  
While Agile caters only to development work, DevOps and BizOps will cater to
the whole end-to-end IT work process.  
  
DevOps (an international best practice) caters to an agile/lean, automated
end-to-end process for application development/enhancement work - starting
from development work and extending to the downstream IT infra/operations work
(e.g. infra setup, deployment and operations/monitoring).  
  
BizOps caters to an agile/lean process for business needs that are directly
catered for by IT infra/ops and IT/project managers without involvement of
software developers. These can be new services (e.g. implementation of new
infra such as IoT sensor network), upgrade of existing services (e.g. upgrade
of wifi network) and work relating to existing services (e.g. service
requests, incident management etc.)  
  
While most DevOps courses touch indirectly on BizOps, this course will
explicitly cover BizOps in addition to DevOps so as to provide a coverage of
lean/agile across all IT services and the roles that all the different IT
management/specialists play in it as well as tools that are important to such
agility.  
  
As DevOps and BizOps do not have a widely-recognised, de-facto certification
body or international standard as yet, this course captures and integrates
international best practices from the industry (e.g. from companies such as
Spotify) so as to provide useful and practical foundational competencies in
DevOps and BizOps.  
  
_You will earn 17.5 PDUs (Technical : 17.5) upon successful completion of this
course. For the purpose of PDU reporting, the ISS PMI® REP Provider Number is
“2339”._  
  
This course is part of the Software Systems series and Digital Agility series

"What is the

  * Apply appropriate DevOps / BizOps principles and practices 
  * Plan and implement integration of DevOps and BizOps to Agile, Lean and ITSM
  * Improve DevOps and BizOps process workflows, communication and feedback loops

"Who should attend 
     DevOps Foundation with BizOps 
 course ?","This is a foundational course, suitable for digital/IT professionals with an
interest or requirement to understand DevOps and BizOps so as to achieve

It is applicable for professionals engaged in the following areas:  
  
All Digital/IT Staff - both developers and non-developers.  
  
**For non-developers** , the course will help them to develop the necessary
skills to enable agility in their work processes to meet the needs of business
in the modern fast-paced digital world. Non-developers can include project
managers, product managers, IT managers, infrastructure teams, release and
deployment teams, support teams, change managers.

may have had in continuous integration with other important non-technical
aspects (e.g. process, culture and people) that are also important for

"Can you give me an overview of

?","We are in a time of unprecedented change, known as the ‘Fourth Industrial
Revolution’. It is characterised by the digital transformation of our world
and the unavoidable interaction between humans, digital technologies and
physical assets. It is an increasingly fast paced and complex environment,
requiring organizations to be more agile, better equipped to adapt what they
do and ready to adopt new ways of working to succeed.  
ITIL 4, through its framework, helps organizations to connect and align these
different challenges that are relevant not only to ITSM professionals, but
also by a wider range of professionals working in the digital world.
ITIL 4 expands previous versions by providing a practical and flexible basis
to support organizations on their journey to the new world of digital
transformation. It provides an end-to-end IT/digital operating model for the
delivery and operation of tech-enabled products and services and enables IT
teams to continue to play a crucial role in wider business strategy.  
  
ITIL 4 supports the existing investment that people and organizations have

"Can you give me an overview of 
     Systems Thinking & Root Cause Analysis 
?","Note: **Systems Thinking & Root Cause Analysis  for Health Services**
is next scheduled for 22-23 July  
Note: **Systems Thinking & Root Cause Analysis  [for all industries]
** is for scheduled for 30-31 May, 07-08 Aug, 19-20 Nov in 2019, and on 06-07
Feb in 2020
**Nb: The course has two versions – a special healthcare version, and a normal
default version for all industry sectors. The details of the two versions are
described below.**
**Version for all industries:**
When we have difficult digitalisation problems to solve, it pays to have good
frameworks and methods to allow the problem to be worked through
systematically and successfully. For example, techniques to cater to
* Complicated problems such as 
  * tough technical problems (e.g. a mission critical system is down) where experts have difficulty finding the root cause 
* Complex problems such as 
  * improving an organisation for which its mission-critical digital services fail repeatedly over time, and the organisation is not able to improve and minimise such incidents 
  * methods to handle an environment that is VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) such as to achieve digital transformation and/or create successful new digital services in spite of the VUCA environment or market 
  * analysing and creating or improving a complex stakeholder ecosystem for a digital service 
* Chaotic problems such as 
  * Major incidents, disasters or crisis causing significant chaos to the organisation and its digital services 
This course will provide systems thinking and root cause analysis skills to
cater to the above. Techniques covered will include Kepnor Tregoe; analysis
and change of systems behaviour (e.g. via System Archetypes, causal loop
mapping and ecosystem analysis and design); analysis and change of people
behaviour (e.g. via understanding and changing mental models, understanding
and working with cognitive biases, allies and adversaries analysis and
approach); Cyenfin Framework approaches to complicated, complex and chaotic
problems and how these are manifested in techniques such as Sense-making, Lean
Startup and Design Thinking as well as in other techniques. Workshops will
allow the participants to gain the skills in relevant approaches.  
  
****
**Health Services Version:**
For practitioners working in healthcare or social care, the specially tailored
‘Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services’ version of this
course will be most relevant. The course will teach the tools and strategies
to help inform decision making in complex situations and especially help
participants grapple with the unique challenges associated with care settings.
The health services course includes application of tools and strategies to
integrated care models as well as mapping different decision-making domains to
the macro, meso and micro levels of healthcare systems. The course is designed
to support participants in framing their challenges within the macro level of
the system, and scoping their solutions down to meso or micro levels. ‘Systems
Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services’ is offered as a
standalone course. It is also one of the five stackable training courses that
make up the NUS Professional Diploma in Smart Health Leadership. Upon
completion of all five stackable training courses, participants are expected
to undertake a capstone project in order to achieve the Professional Diploma
award.  
  
This course is part of the Digital Agility as well as the Professional Diploma
in Smart Health Leadership offered by NUS-ISS.
