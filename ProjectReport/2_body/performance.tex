We perform validation on 2 different scenarios (shown in Appendix \ref{cha:demo}) to ensure that IChat provides the correct expected output.

Scenario 1 is a future student wants to check some information about \textbf{Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems}, which is under \textbf{Graduate Programme}. This student wants to know when the next intake time and how long will the programme last. In this scenario, the user only need to click suggestion button to get answers.

Scenario 2 is an employee wants to learn more about \textbf{Machine Reasoning} course in \textbf{Executive Education Programmes}. The user needs to input questions related to the course in this scenario.

According to Success Measurements mentioned in Section \ref{sec:success_measurements}, IChat proved its performance in these scenarios.
