Working in this ever-change world, No one can continue to grow only through past learning experiences. It is relieved that more and more people in Singapore are pursuing post-graduate studies \cite{postgrad}. Most of us decided on our Bachelorâ€™s when we were young. Not all the people know what they want when taking a major. After gaining some experience during working, people have a clearer path and idea what they want.
