# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Working in this ever-change world, No one can continue to grow only through past learning experiences. It is relieved that more and more people in Singapore are pursuing postgraduate studies\cite{postgrad}. Most of us decided on our Bachelorâ€™s when we were young. Not all the people know what they want when taking a major. After gaining a lot more experience during working, people have a clearer path and idea what they want.

National University of Singapore - Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS) upskills people through skills-based, industry-relevant courses so that they stay competitive in the digital age. The courses it provided is more practical and industry-based skills compared with traditional Postgraduate education.

Although NUS-ISS has a user-friendly website, it may still be a challenge for a learner to find information fast and accurate. A research showed over 75\% users rank ease of finding the information as the most important factor in a website.

For NUS-ISS website to successful, our team targeted to create a chat bot. It can interact with user directly to answer relevant questions. The technology we utilised included Dialogflow and Slack.
